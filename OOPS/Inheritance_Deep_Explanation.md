# INHERITANCE – Final Deep Explanation (Amazon/Microsoft-Level)

1️⃣ Definition:  
Inheritance is the process where one class (child/derived) acquires the properties and behaviors (methods) of another class (parent/base).

📌 Think of inheritance like a child inheriting traits from a parent – both physical (attributes) and behavioral (methods).

   - Use the attributes and methods of the parent class
   - Override parent class methods to provide a specific implementation
   = Add its own additional attributes and methods


2️⃣ Real-World Analogy:  
Imagine you're building a vehicle system.

Parent Class: Vehicle (has speed, fuel, start() method)

Child Classes: Car, Bike, Truck – they all "inherit" from Vehicle but have their own specialties like number_of_wheels, or cargo_capacity.

🎯 If you design each vehicle type separately, you repeat the same start()/stop() logic.  
With inheritance, you write once in Vehicle, reuse in all.

3️⃣ Syntax:
```python
class Parent:
    def greet(self):
        print("Hello from Parent")

class Child(Parent):  # Inheriting
    pass

obj = Child()
obj.greet()  # Works because greet() is inherited
```

4️⃣ Simple Example:
```python
class Animal:
    def sound(self):
        print("Animal makes sound")

class Dog(Animal):
    def bark(self):
        print("Dog barks")

d = Dog()
d.sound()  # Inherited
d.bark()   # Child-specific
```

5️⃣ Amazon-Level Problem Example  
🔍 Problem: Design a PaymentSystem for E-Commerce  
📌 Requirements:  
Common functionality: initiate_payment(), cancel_payment()

Payment Types: CreditCard, UPI, Wallet, etc.

Each payment method has its own validation logic.

🔧 Why Inheritance?  
✅ You avoid repeating common payment code.  
✅ Child classes customize behavior (polymorphism).

🧱 Design Thought Process:  
Base Class:  
- Payment  
    - initiate_payment()  
    - cancel_payment()

Child Classes:  
- CreditCardPayment → validate_card()  
- UPIPayment → validate_upi()  
- WalletPayment → validate_wallet()

🧑‍💻 Code Implementation:
```python
class Payment:
    def __init__(self, amount):
        self.amount = amount

    def initiate_payment(self):
        print(f"Initiating payment of ₹{self.amount}")

    def cancel_payment(self):
        print("Payment cancelled")

class CreditCardPayment(Payment):
    def validate_card(self):
        print("Validating Credit Card details")

class UPIPayment(Payment):
    def validate_upi(self):
        print("Validating UPI ID")

# Usage
credit = CreditCardPayment(500)
credit.initiate_payment()
credit.validate_card()

upi = UPIPayment(300)
upi.initiate_payment()
upi.validate_upi()
```

| Concept               | Description                     | Example             |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------|
| Single Inheritance     | One child, one parent           | class A, class B(A)  |
| Multiple Inheritance   | One child, multiple parents     | class C(A, B)        |
| Multilevel Inheritance | Chain of inheritance            | A → B → C           |
| Hierarchical Inheritance | One parent, many children     | A → B, A → C        |
| Method Overriding      | Redefine a method in child      | def start() in both  |
| super()                | Call parent’s method            | super().method()     |
| Constructor Chaining   | Reuse parent __init__           | super().__init__()   |

🔥 Must-Prepare Interview Scenarios:

| Scenario                         | Asked In           |
|---------------------------------|--------------------|
| Payment system with different methods | Amazon, Flipkart  |
| Animal class with sound variations | Infosys, Cognizant |
| Vehicle base class with subclasses | Microsoft          |
| Employee – Manager – Intern hierarchy | Amazon, Accenture  |

📚 Tip:  
✅ Use inheritance when:  
- Classes share common functionality  
- You want to follow DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)  
- You need future extension/flexibility  

⛔ Avoid inheritance when:  
- Classes are completely unrelated  
- You’re better off using composition
