# DRY Principle (Scratch ‚Üí Advanced) & Parking Lot System Example

---

## üîπ Step 1: What is DRY? (Definition + Example)

**Definition (simple words):**  
DRY means don‚Äôt write the same logic more than once. Write it in one place and reuse it everywhere.

**Real-life Example:**  
Imagine you write your phone number on 10 different forms. Tomorrow, your number changes. Now you must update all 10 forms ‚Üí painful.  
Instead, you could just write it once in your ID card and tell everyone to refer there.

**Code Example:**

‚ùå Without DRY:
```python
def get_area_of_square(side):
    return side * side

def print_square_area(side):
    print("Area:", side * side)  # repeated logic
```

‚úÖ With DRY:
```python
def get_area_of_square(side):
    return side * side

def print_square_area(side):
    print("Area:", get_area_of_square(side))  # reused
```

üëâ Logic written once. If formula changes, update in one place only.

---

## üîπ Step 2: When to Apply DRY?

**Rule:** If you see yourself copy-pasting code ‚Üí stop. That‚Äôs the moment to apply DRY.

**Real-life Example:**  
Think about school homework. Instead of copying the same multiplication table on 10 pages, you write it once and say: ‚ÄúThis applies for all.‚Äù

**Code Example:**

‚ùå Without DRY:
```python
# User registration
if "@" not in email or len(password) < 6:
    print("Invalid input")

# User login
if "@" not in email or len(password) < 6:
    print("Invalid input")
```

‚úÖ With DRY:
```python
def validate_user(email, password):
    return "@" in email and len(password) >= 6

# User registration
if not validate_user(email, password):
    print("Invalid input")

# User login
if not validate_user(email, password):
    print("Invalid input")
```

üëâ Now, validation logic is one place only.

---

## üîπ Step 3: Where to Apply DRY?

Apply DRY in common, repeating logic like:

- Calculations  
- Validations  
- Logging  
- Configuration  
- Database queries  

**Real-life Example:**  
In Amazon, ‚Äúdelivery charges calculation‚Äù is common for cart, checkout, and order summary. If you repeat it everywhere ‚Üí nightmare.

**Code Example (Amazon-style):**

‚ùå Without DRY:
```python
class Cart:
    def calculate_delivery_fee(self, distance):
        if distance < 5: return 20
        else: return 50

class Order:
    def calculate_delivery_fee(self, distance):
        if distance < 5: return 20
        else: return 50
```

‚úÖ With DRY:
```python
class DeliveryFeeCalculator:
    @staticmethod
    def calculate(distance):
        if distance < 5: return 20
        else: return 50

class Cart:
    def calculate_delivery_fee(self, distance):
        return DeliveryFeeCalculator.calculate(distance)

class Order:
    def calculate_delivery_fee(self, distance):
        return DeliveryFeeCalculator.calculate(distance)
```

üëâ One place ‚Üí less headache.

---

## üîπ Step 4: What if You Don‚Äôt Apply DRY? (Impact)

**Real-life Example:**  
Your teacher changes multiplication table logic (say from base 10 to base 12 üòÖ).  
If you wrote it on 20 pages, you must erase all ‚Üí waste of time.

**Impact in Coding:**

- Bugs (forgetting to change in one place)  
- Wasted time  
- Hard to scale  

**Code Example:**

‚ùå Without DRY:
```python
# In 3 different files
total = price * qty * 1.18   # hard-coded GST
```

Now GST changes ‚Üí you must update in all 3 files. If you miss one, your app gives wrong results.

‚úÖ With DRY:
```python
GST = 1.18

def calculate_total(price, qty):
    return price * qty * GST
```

üëâ One change updates everywhere.

---

## üîπ Step 5: Advantages of DRY

- Easier maintenance  
- Reusable code  
- Cleaner design (interviewer loves this)  
- Fewer bugs  

**Real-life Example:**  
Think of a Google Doc ‚Üí you update one file, everyone sees the update.  
Instead of sending 10 copies and updating each.

**Code Example:**  
Without DRY ‚Üí you write tax calculation in Cart, Order, Invoice separately.  
With DRY ‚Üí you write once in `TaxCalculator`.

# Parking Lot System ‚Äì Step by Step Approach (With DRY)

---

## Step 0: Understand the Problem (Clarify Requirements)

**Interviewer asks:**  
‚ÄúDesign a Parking Lot system. Users can park vehicles (Car, Bike, Truck). System should generate tickets, track vehicles, and calculate fees.‚Äù

**Questions to Clarify:**

- How many vehicle types? (Car, Bike, Bus)  
- How is the fee calculated? Fixed or dynamic?  
- Is there a limit on parking slots?  
- Should it handle entry/exit time?  

**Always think:** ‚ÄúI want clear inputs, outputs, and constraints.‚Äù

---

## Step 1: Identify Classes (Think in terms of objects)

Speak aloud:

> ‚ÄúFrom the requirements, I see these objects:
>
> - ParkingLot ‚Üí main system  
> - Vehicle ‚Üí base class for Car, Bike, Truck  
> - ParkingSlot ‚Üí represents a parking spot  
> - Ticket ‚Üí holds info about parking, time, fee  
> - FeeCalculator ‚Üí calculates fees (important for DRY)‚Äù

‚úÖ Key point: think in terms of **reusability and DRY**.

---

## Step 2: Identify Repeated Logic (Where DRY applies)

Speak aloud:

> ‚ÄúI notice some logic can be repeated:
>
> - Fee calculation for different vehicles  
> - Ticket generation  
> - Validation (e.g., check if a slot is free)‚Äù

> ‚ÄúThese can be extracted into reusable components instead of copying in multiple classes.‚Äù

---

## Step 3: Define Classes Using DRY

### FeeCalculator + Vehicle
```python
class FeeCalculator:
    @staticmethod
    def calculate(vehicle_type, hours):
        if vehicle_type == "Car":
            base, extra = 20, 10
        elif vehicle_type == "Bike":
            base, extra = 10, 5
        elif vehicle_type == "Bus":
            base, extra = 50, 25
        else:
            raise ValueError("Invalid vehicle type")
        
        if hours <= 2:
            return base
        else:
            return base + (hours - 2) * extra

class Vehicle:
    def __init__(self, vehicle_type, hours):
        self.vehicle_type = vehicle_type
        self.hours = hours

    def calculate_fee(self):
        return FeeCalculator.calculate(self.vehicle_type, self.hours)
```

**Explain to interviewer:**  
> ‚ÄúInstead of writing fee calculation inside Car, Bike, Truck separately, I created a static `FeeCalculator`.  
> Now all vehicle types reuse it. This is **DRY principle in action**. If Amazon changes the fee rule tomorrow, I update only in one place.‚Äù

---

### Ticket Generation
```python
class Ticket:
    ticket_counter = 0

    @staticmethod
    def generate(vehicle, slot_id):
        Ticket.ticket_counter += 1
        return f"TICKET-{Ticket.ticket_counter}-{vehicle.vehicle_type}-Slot{slot_id}"
```

---

### ParkingLot Class
```python
class ParkingLot:
    def __init__(self, car_slots, bike_slots, bus_slots):
        self.available_slots = {"Car": car_slots, "Bike": bike_slots, "Bus": bus_slots}
        self.occupied_slots = {"Car": [], "Bike": [], "Bus": []}

    def park_vehicle(self, vehicle):
        v_type = vehicle.vehicle_type
        if self.available_slots[v_type] <= 0:
            print(f"No {v_type} slots available!")
            return None

        slot_id = len(self.occupied_slots[v_type]) + 1
        self.occupied_slots[v_type].append(vehicle)
        self.available_slots[v_type] -= 1

        ticket = Ticket.generate(vehicle, slot_id)
        fee = vehicle.calculate_fee()
        print(f"{v_type} parked at slot {slot_id}, Ticket: {ticket}, Fee: {fee}")
        return ticket
```

---

### Step 4: Test Parking Lot System
```python
# Create parking lot
parking_lot = ParkingLot(car_slots=5, bike_slots=3, bus_slots=2)

# Park vehicles
v1 = Vehicle("Car", 3)
v2 = Vehicle("Bike", 1)
v3 = Vehicle("Bus", 4)

parking_lot.park_vehicle(v1)
parking_lot.park_vehicle(v2)
parking_lot.park_vehicle(v3)
```

**Expected Output:**  
```
Car parked at slot 1, Ticket: TICKET-1-Car-Slot1, Fee: 30
Bike parked at slot 1, Ticket: TICKET-2-Bike-Slot1, Fee: 10
Bus parked at slot 1, Ticket: TICKET-3-Bus-Slot1, Fee: 75
```

## ‚úÖ Key Takeaways

- DRY = write once, reuse everywhere  
- Centralize repeating logic like **fees, validation, ticket generation**  
- Makes code **maintainable, scalable, and bug-free**  
- Always **think aloud** in interviews and show **how DRY applies**
